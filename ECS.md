ECS is elastic container service which is managed by AWS and not an open source. Where as EKS is open source.
To create the container in ECS we will use docker image so for that first we need to register the image in the AMAZON CONTAINER REGISTRY ( ECR ). Then from that we can run push that image and create the conatainer.

To create the conatiner we need to define the task. So by running the task conatiner will be created and running.
